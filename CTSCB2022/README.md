# Bioinformatics Rotation Training

This page is designed for 2022-intake students in 
[CTSCB](https://www.hkstemcell.hk) to get preliminary training in 
bioinformatics and analytics skills in single-cell data.


The rotation training is one day per week, across 8 weeks. Besides the training 
day, there will be a few hours of self-reading & practice to further enhance the
skills.

## Week 1: Basic programming with R
* Read the 1h course material on 
  [Quantitative_Skills_I](https://github.com/StatBiomed/GenomeScienceCourse/blob/master/quant_skills/Quantitative_Skills_I_YHuang.pdf)
* Finish the exercise in [slide P22](https://github.com/StatBiomed/GenomeScienceCourse/blob/master/quant_skills/Quantitative_Skills_I_YHuang.pdf)
* Read and try the [materials designed by Joshua Ho & lab](https://holab-hku.github.io/R-workshop/) chapters 1 to 7.
* Other resources include [Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/Rintro.html)


## Week 2: Analysis of bulk RNA-Seq
* read my lecture notes 
  [Transcriptomics I & II](https://github.com/StatBiomed/GenomeScienceCourse/tree/master/transcriptomics)
* finish the [Assignment 1](https://github.com/StatBiomed/GenomeScienceCourse/tree/master/assignments)
* Read and try the [materials designed by Joshua Ho & lab](https://holab-hku.github.io/R-workshop/) chapter 8.
* Other resources include [Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/rnaseqanalysis.html) chapter 8.


## Week 3: Single-cell data pre-processing
* Learn Linux Command Lines
* Start to use Center Computing server
<!-- * Alignment and reads counting: [smart-seq data](https://github.com/huangyh09/brie/tree/master/examples/gastrulation) -->
* CellRanger for 10x genomics data: [3K PBMC data](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/3-k-pbm-cs-from-a-healthy-donor-1-standard-1-1-0)
* Read and play with [Workshop materials](https://holab-hku.github.io/Fundamental-scRNA/)


## Week 4: Seurat for single-cell analysis
* Seurat [tutorial with 3K PBMC data](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)
* Read and play with [Workshop materials](https://holab-hku.github.io/Fundamental-scRNA/) chapter 3


## Week 5: Cell clustering & annotation
* 10x genomic data, tentatively from the [CARLIN paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30554-7)
* Annotation by markers
* Annotation by automatic prediction


## Week 6: Mitochondrial variants analysis
* Analyse one dataset. Tentatively the CARLIN data and a [TNBC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28845-0/figures/5) data
* Read and play with [Workshop materials](https://statbiomed.github.io/SingleCell-Workshop-2021/SNV-analysis.html) chapter 4


## Week 7-8: Project & presentation
* Tentatively, NPC case & control comparison or one dataset from our center
